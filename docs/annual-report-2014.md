# ASCM Website and Database Annual Report 2014

_Claudine Chionh_

2013 has been a big year for bringing our website and database into the 21st century. My goals have been to make good use of current and emerging digital media tools to help spread the SCM members share the responsibility of keeping contacts up-to-date in each local branch or state.

## Website and social media

The website has been rebuilt (at the existing address, [http://ascm.org.au/](http://ascm.org.au/)) using the Drupal content management system, which enables multiple users to create and edit content directly on the website. Ideally, there would be at least one person in each state with editing rights – please speak to me about getting access if you don't already have it.

When I rebuilt the website, Ann Ng and I reviewed the content of the previous version of the site and copied over content that was still relevant. We could definitely do with more information about current local groups.

The website has an active blog section at [http://ascm.org.au/blog](http://ascm.org.au/blog). Comments are allowed but moderated – they need to be checked by an administrator before being published.

We have left Ilisys and the new website is hosted on a virtual private server that I use for a number of small community projects.

ASCM also has a Facebook page at [https://www.facebook.com/AustralianStudentChristianMovement](https://www.facebook.com/AustralianStudentChristianMovement), which has a few administrators. We are able to post brief updates and share links and events. The page also re-posts articles from our blog.

## Contact database

The contact database of current members and senior Friends has been moved from Microsoft Access (an inadequate system for many reasons) to Batchbook, an online contact management system. ASCM staff and volunteers should use this system rather than personal address lists, as a centralised system enables us to keep information up-to-date and reduces duplication.

We can organise contacts into lists (for example, for specific universities or area councils). We can send email to lists of up to twenty people. For larger lists, we use Mailchimp, an online newsletter system. Our list on Mailchimp has 240 members and includes sub-groups for advertising events in Victoria. Please speak to me if you would like to use Mailchimp to send emails within your state or branch – as with all these online systems, we can add multiple users and administrators.

## Question: Twitter?

Alongside Facebook, the other big social media network is Twitter. Should ASCM get a Twitter account? This could help increase our visibility and our ability to share links and interact with other SCMs and student groups.

Some SCMs on Twitter:
