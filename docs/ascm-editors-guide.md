# ASCM content editors' guide

## Menus

This document refers to two kinds of 'Menu':

- The Main Menu (larger text, green background) appears above the ASCM logo and banner on every page, and can be seen by anyone.
- The Admin Menu (smaller text, black background) appears at the very top of the page and can only be seen by staff who are logged in.

## Adding to the blog

Articles appear under the **Blog** link on the Main menu. Articles from the old Blogspot blog have been imported into the new site.

To add an article to the blog, go to Admin Menu > Content > Add content > Article.

**Title** and **Body** are required. **Tags** and **Images** are optional. To add one or more images, click **Select media**, and either Upload a new image or select a previously uploaded image from the Library.

## Adding to resource pages

Resource pages appear in a hierarchical structure under the **Resources** link on the Main menu.

To add or update Resources, go to the top level [Resources page](http://www.ascm.org.au/info/resources). If a page already exists for your topic, go to that page and click the **Edit** tab above the page title. Otherwise, click **Add child page**.

**Title** and **Body** are required. **File attachments** are optional. To add one or more attachments, click **Select media**, and either Upload a new attachment or select a previously uploaded attachment from the Library.

Changes to Resource pages are moderated - they need to be reviewed and published by an administrator (Claudine).
