# Contact management with Batchbook

ASCM uses an online Contact Relationship Management (CRM) system called Batchbook to maintain a database of current and former members, supporters, and other useful contacts. ASCM staff and volunteers should use this system rather than personal address lists, as a centralised system enables us to keep information up-to-date and reduces duplication.

If you have any questions about any of this, **please ask Claudine** at claudine@ascm.org.au

**Log in** to Batchbook at https://ascm.batchbook.com/ (you may want to bookmark this link).

**Search for contacts** either from the Search box at the top-right-hand corner of every page, or from the Contacts page which enables you to filter the search results.

Each contact record is for one individual person. When creating snail-mail address lists, Claudine does some additional processing to merge members of the same household onto one label.

You can edit a record as you see it on the page. There is no Save button; just use the Tab key to move to the next field, and the field you were in will be updated.

Contacts can be recorded as employees (or volunteers) of one or more **Companies** (or organisations). If you start typing a company name in the Company field in a Contact record, the system will try to find any other companies with a matching name and you can click on the company name to select it. This will help to maintain consistency of names across the system.

Contacts and companies can have one or more **Tags**. These can be used to group contacts in as many ways as we can think of. Two of the main uses of tags in the ASCM system are to group contacts into area councils and campuses (as students or staff). They can also be used to build advanced searches which can be saved as **Lists**.

You can send email directly to all members of a list if there are no more than **twenty** contacts in that list. To send email to more than twenty contacts at once, we use **Mailchimp** ... (to be written up)
